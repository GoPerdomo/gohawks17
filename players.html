            <h4>Russell Wilson - Quarterback</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="player-description">
            <p>
              Considered too short for a Quarterback, and refused by many teams because of that, Russell Wilson has proven that his size
              is not a problem and became one of the best active QB in the league: In 2015, he became the first quarterback
              in NFL history to have 4,000 or more passing yards, 30 or more passing touchdowns, and 500 or more rushing
              yards in the same season.
              <br>
              <br> Wilson suffered multiple injuries on the 2016 season but still managed to finish it with 4,219 passing yards
              (setting his career high and franchise record), 21 passing touchdowns, 259 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown.
              Now, healthy once again, he plans to lead his team all the way to the Super Bowl LII.

            <h4>Legion of Boom - Seattle Seahawks' Secondary</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="player-description">
            <p>
              "Legion of Boom", or LOB, is the nickname for the Defensive Backs of the Seahawks. Composed mainly by the All-Pro players
              Earl Thomas III (Free Safety), Kam Chancellor (Strong Safety) and Richard Sherman (Cornerback), they have being
              leading the league in various defensive categories since its formation, in 2011.
              <br>
              <br> On 2016, Thomas III got injured with a broken leg, ending the season for him. He is now recovering from it
              and is expect to join his mates on 2017.
              <br>
              <br> The Seattle Seahawks also re-signed its 2nd Cornerback, DeShawn Shead, during the Free Agency.

          <div class="player-description">
            <p>
              Bobby Wagner finished the 2016 season with impressive 167 tackles, leading the NFL and setting the franchise record for most
              tackles in one season. He also holds the record for most tackles in Super Bowls, with 22.
              <br>
              <br> The All-Pro's work, together with the Legion of Boom, has made the Seahawks' defense one of the most feared
              in the league.

          </div>
          <div class="player-description">
            <p>
              The only player in this list that hasn't started his carrer with the Seattle Seahawks, Jimmy Graham made history with the
              New Orleans Saints before being traded for the Center Max Unger in 2015. On the same year, while still getting
              used to his new team, he suffered a patellar tendon rupture and missed the rest of the season.
              <br>
              <br> In 2016, fully recovered from his injury, Graham has made a great comeback and finished the season with 923
              receiving yards, 65 receptions, and 6 touchdowns.

            <h4>Doug Baldwin - Wide Receiver</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="player-description">
            <p>
              Another underestimated player, Doug Baldwin was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Seahawks in 2011 and spent years
              being called "pedestrian" and "mediocre". Much like Russell Wilson, he has proven everyone wrong: In 2015 he
              joined Hall of Famer Jerry Rice as the only players in league history with at least 10 receiving touchdowns
              in a four-game span and caught at least two touchdowns in four straight games, a feat that only Calvin Johnson
              and Hall of Famer Cris Carter have accomplished since 1960. He also set the franchise record and lead the league
              for most receiving touchdowns in a single season, with 14, and was ranked as the 72nd best player in the NFL
              on the Top 100 Players of 2016.
